                    <h4>Responsive, jQuery, Bootstrap</h4>
                    <p>
                        The artist requested a website that she could present as a portfolio of her art. It was important that
                        as her collection grew, she could seamlessly add additional pictures and categories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My main focus on this project was creating a website that was also mobile-friendly. I used Bootstrap
                        to create two different navigation bars: one for mobile devices and one for desktop. Media queries were used
                        in CSS to re-orient elements on resize. I also used this as an opportunity to get mor acquainted with jQuery.
                        jQuery is used to build and animate the navigation bar.

                    <h2>First Edition</h2>
                    <h4>API, AJAX, jQuery</h4>
                    <p>
                        The idea for this website came to me when I was about to head out to a local comic book store. I
                        decided
                        to check their website for store hours and this week's new shipment of issues. Their website
                        turned out
                        to be an unfortunate mess. While I was able to ultimately find the information I was looking
                        for, the website
                        was simply too cluttered with a large assortment of pictures. I figured anyone really visiting
                        the site was looking
                        for information: address, phone, store inventory, and possibly events. This site aimed to
                        deliver on these expectations
                        with no clutter.
                    </p>
                    <p>The project gave me the opportunity to work with another API; in this case, Marvel's API can make
                        requests for comics
                        based on release date, character, events, and more. I used this API to mimic a store inventory.
                        Using asynchronous
                        AJAX calls, the First Edition website cleanly loads new and featured issues.

                    <h4>MongoDB, Angular, React</h4>
                    <p>
                        I plan on adding several more projects to this website. I've worked with MongoDB in the past and
                        I would like to do so again. I'm currently in the process of templating a web application that uses
                        a popular front-end library such as React or Angular. I'm excited about learning new tools!
