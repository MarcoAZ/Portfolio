                    <h2>Capstone Project: Catalyst Partnerships</h2>
                    <h4>MongoDB, Bootstrap, NodeJS</h4>
                    <p>
                        My capstone project at Oregon State University was a group effort with two other students. One of
                        them reached out to a local client that was interested in a web application that could handle
                        application submissions and processing. <a href="http://www.catalystnw.org/"> Catalyst Partnerships NW</a>
                        is a not-for-profit construction company that helps coordinate repairs for to aid under-resourced
                        people in their community. We were able to deliver a web app that helps Catalyst streamline their workflow.
                        Their workflow requires receiving an application, reviewing it, and conducting a phone interview
                        before they get together to approve work to be completed.
                    </p>

                    <p>There is TONS to cover in this project so I though it best to attach our
                        <a href="data/CapstoneFinalReport.pdf"> final project report</a> which covers in excruciating detail
                        how it all came together and what we used to do it. I was directly responsible for the
                        <a href="http://marcoaz.com/catalyst/view/5940414832e378333712da3c">application review page</a>
                        and the <a href="http://marcoaz.com/catalyst/view">home page for viewing all applications</a>. These pages
                        needed to take the data model and make it viewable and editable. Perhaps my favorite work was
                        making each attribute inline-editable as well as the user access to CRUD notes for each application.
                    </p>

                        <p>...this is stunning work. This is one of the best student projects I've ever seen...</p>
                        <p>Backend to front end, there's so much work that was done! And managing a project this size isn't easy,
                            in addition to learning the technologies and managing the rest of your courseload.</p>

                    <h4>Responsive, jQuery, Bootstrap</h4>
                    <p>
                        The artist requested a website that she could present as a portfolio of her art. It was important that
                        as her collection grew, she could seamlessly add additional pictures and categories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My main focus on this project was creating a website that was also mobile-friendly. I used Bootstrap
                        to create two different navigation bars: one for mobile devices and one for desktop. Media queries were used
                        in CSS to re-orient elements on resize. I also used this as an opportunity to get mor acquainted with jQuery.
                        jQuery is used to build and animate the navigation bar.

                        A web app for simulating the prize drops when opening a loot box, called orbs, in the mobile game <a href="https://www.marvelstrikeforce.com/en/">Marvel Strike Force</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>As required by law (or maybe just by Apple/Google app requirements), the game provides the percent chance of each prize in an orb.
                      For instance, a Mega Orb has a 15% chance to drop an uncommon prize and an 85% chance to drop a common prize. This simulator allows players
                      to test their luck without having to spend currency, either real or in-game, while also demonstrating how the odds are stacked against them.

                      <h4>API, AJAX, jQuery</h4>
                      <p>
                          The idea for this website came to me when I was about to head out to a local comic book store. I
                          decided to check their website for store hours and this week's new shipment of issues. Their website
                          turned out to be an unfortunate mess. While I was able to ultimately find the information I was looking
                          for, the website was simply too cluttered with a large assortment of pictures. I figured anyone really visiting
                          the site was looking for information: address, phone, store inventory, and possibly events. This site aimed to
                          deliver on these expectations
                          with no clutter.
                      </p>
                      <p>The project gave me the opportunity to work with another API; in this case, Marvel's API can make
                          requests for comics
                          based on release date, character, events, and more. I used this API to mimic a store inventory.
                          Using asynchronous
                          AJAX calls, the First Edition website cleanly loads new and featured issues.

                        This is a simple point of sale system I was asked to create as part of a job interview. The user is capable of CRUD actions for
						menu items, taxes, and promotional discounts. It features a user creation and login screen. Orders are created by selecting items
						and any applicable discounts. The bill dynamically updates the list of items and the total including taxes and discounts whenever
						an item is added. On order completion, the order is added to a sales history table with information such as time of sale, cashier name, total, and total taxes/discounts.

                        a popular front-end library such as React or Angular. I'm excited about learning new tools!
