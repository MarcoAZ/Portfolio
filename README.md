# Portfolio
###Purpose:
This project will act as my portfolio as I collect more projects that I put together in my spare time.
Each project in my portfolio is chosen in part because I want to put my own spin on something I've already seen or want to 
build new skills by working with new tools or aspects of web development.

### Other Goals:
Besides serving as a portfolio, I will also take the opportunity to incorporate some CSS animations, which I have never
 deeply explored in the past.
 
### Third-Party Aspects:
| Name          | Use                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Google Fonts  | Bring in some pretty fonts        |
| Font Awesome  | Some nice icons for the nav       |
| Bootstrap     | Help make responsive to re-sizing |
